            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A while after he received this Anſwer, which you have here (taken from her own hand) under that diſguiſed Name ſhe had given him, it being her cuſtom to uſe ſuch with moſt of her particular friends.</p>

                           <hi>IT is very well that you chid me ſo much for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to expreſs a part of the ſenſe I have of your obligations; for while you go on in conferring them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all poſſibility of acknowledgment, it is convenient for me to be forbidden to attempt it. Your laſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous concern for me, in vindicating me from the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy uſage I have received at</hi> London <hi>from the Preſs, doth as much tranſcend all your former favours, as the injury done me by that Publiſher and Printer exceeds all the troubles that I remember I ever had.

                           <hi>it ſelf to have printed thoſe Rimes (you tell me are gotten abroad ſo impudently) with ſo much abuſe to the things, as the very publication of them at all, though they had been never ſo correct, had been to me; to me (Sir) who never writ any line in my life with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have it printed, and who am of my Lord</hi> Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<hi>'s mind, that ſaid,</hi>

                           <hi>And who (I think you know) am ſufficiently diſtruſtful of all, that my own want of company and better employment, or others commands have ſeduc'd me to write, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor rather that they ſhould never be ſeen at all, than that they ſhould be expos'd to the world with ſuch</hi> effrontery <hi>as now they moſt unhappily are. But is there no retreat from the malice of this World? I thought a Rock and a Mountain might have hidden me, and that it had been free for all to ſpend their Solitude in what</hi> Reſveries <hi>they pleaſe, and that our Rivers (though they are bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) would not have betray'd the follies of impertinent thoughts upon their Banks; but 'tis only I who am that unfortunate perſon that cannot ſo much as think in private, that muſt have my imaginations rifled and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to play the Mountebanks, and dance upon the Ropes to entertain all the rabble; to undergo all the</hi> rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery <hi>of the Wits, and all the ſeverity of the Wiſe, and to be the ſport of ſome that can, and ſome that cannot read a Verſe. This is a moſt cruel accident, and hath made ſo proportionate an impreſſion upon me, that really it hath coſt me a ſharp fit of ſickneſs ſince I heard it, and I believe would be more fatal but that I know what a Champion I have in you, and that I am ſure your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the World will gain me a belief from all that are knowing and civil, that I am ſo innocent of that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Artifice of a ſecret conſent (of which I am, I fear, ſuſpected) that whoever would have brought me thoſe</hi>

                           <hi>Copies corrected and amended, and a thouſand pounds to have bought my permiſſion for their being printed, ſhould not have obtained it. But though there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, I believe, in this wicked impreſſion of thoſe fancies, which the ignorance of what occaſion'd them, and the falſeneſs of the Copies may repreſent very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and extravagant, yet I could give ſome account of them to the ſevereſt</hi> Cato, <hi>and I am ſure they muſt be more abus'd than I think is poſſible (for I have not ſeen the Book, nor can imagine what's in't) before they can be render'd otherwiſe than Sir</hi> Edward Deering <hi>ſays in his Epilogue to</hi> Pompey.</p>

However I hope you will ſatisfie all your acquaintance of my averſion to it, and did they know me as well as you do, that Apology were very needleſs, for I am ſo far from expecting applauſe for any thing I ſcribble, that I can hardly expect pardon; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I think that employment ſo far above my reach, and unfit for my Sex, that I am going to reſolve againſt it for ever; and could I have recovered thoſe fugitive Papers that have eſcap'd my hands, I had long ſince</hi>

                           <hi>made a ſacrifice of them all. The truth is, I have an incorrigible inclination to that folly of riming, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the effects of that humour, only for my own amuſement in a retir'd life; I did not ſo much reſiſt it as a wiſer woman would have done; but ſome of my deareſt friends having found my Ballads, (for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no better name) they made me ſo much believe they did not diſlike them, that I was betray'd to permit ſome Copies for their divertiſement; but this, with ſo little concern for them, that I have loſt moſt of the originals, and that I ſuppoſe to be the cauſe of my preſent misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; for ſome infernal Spirits or other have catch'd thoſe rags of Paper, and what the careleſs blotted writing kept them from underſtanding, they have ſupplied by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, till they put them into the ſhape wherein you ſaw them, or elſe I know not which way it is poſſible for them to be collected, or ſo abominably tranſcrib'd as I hear they are. I believe alſo there are ſome among them that are not mine, but every way I have ſo much injury, and the worthy perſons that had the ill luck of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and ſo their Names expos'd in this impreſſion without their leave, that few things in the power of Fortune could have given me ſo great a torment as this moſt afflictive accident. I know you Sir, ſo much my friend, that I need not ask your pardon for making this tedious complaint; but methinks it is a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to revenge my ſelf upon you by this</hi> Harangue <hi>for the wrongs I have received from others; therefore I will only tell you that the ſole advantage I have by this cruel news, is that it has given me an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That no adverſity can ſhake the conſtancy of your friendſhip, and that in the worſt humour that ever I was in, I am ſtill,</hi>

It may ſerve likewiſe to give a taſte of her Proſe to thoſe that have ſeen none of it, and of her way of writing familiar Letters, which ſhe did with ſtrange readineſs and facility, in a very fair hand, and perfect Orthography; and if they were collected with thoſe excellent Diſcourſes ſhe writ on ſeveral ſubjects, they would make a Volume much larger than this, and no leſs worth the reading.</p>
                  <p>About three months after this Letter ſhe came to <hi>London,</hi> where her Friends did much ſollicite her to redeem her ſelf by a correct impreſſion; yet ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill averſe, though perhaps in time ſhe might have been over-rul'd by their perſwaſions if ſhe had lived.</p>
                  <p>But the ſmall Pox, that malicious diſeaſe (as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how little ſhe would have been concern'd for her handſomneſs, when at the beſt) was not ſatisfied to be as injurious a Printer of her face, as the other had been of her Poems, but treated her with a more fatal cruelty than the Stationer had them; for though he to her moſt ſenſible affliction ſurreptitiouſly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd himſelf of a falſe Copy, and ſent thoſe children of her Fancy into the World, ſo martyred, that they were more unlike themſelves than ſhe could have been made had ſhe eſcaped; that murtherous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, with greater barbarity ſeiz'd unexpectedly upon her, the true Original, and to the much juſter affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all the world, violently tore her out of it, and hurried her untimely to her Grave, upon the 22. of <hi>June</hi> 1664. ſhe being then but 31 years of age.</p>
                  <p>But he could not bury her in Oblivion, for this Monument which ſhe erected for her ſelf, will for ever make her to be honoured as the honour of her Sex, the emulation of ours, and the admiration of both. That unfortunate ſurpriſe hath rob'd it of
<pb facs="tcp:96989:7"/>
much of that perfection it might elſe have had, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broke off the Tranſlation of <hi>Horace</hi> before it was finiſh'd, much leſs review'd, and hindred the reſt from being more exactly corrected, and put into the order they were written in, as ſhe poſſibly her ſelf would have done, had ſhe conſented to a ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. 'Tis probable ſhe would alſo have left out ſome of thoſe pieces that were written with leſs care and upon occaſions leſs fit to be made publick, and ſhe might alſo have added more<hi>:</hi> but all induſtry has been us'd to make this Collection as full and as perfect as might be, by the addition of many that were not in the former impreſſion, and by divers Tranſlations, whereof the firſt has the Original in the oppoſite Page, that they who have a mind to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, may by that pattern find how juſt ſhe has been in all the reſt to both the Languages, exactly rendring the full ſence of the one, without tying her ſelf ſtrictly to the words, and clearly evincing the capaciouſneſs of the other, by compriſing it fully in the ſame number of lines, though in the Plays half the Verſes of the French are of thirteen ſyllables, and the reſt of twelve, whereas the Engliſh have no more but ten. In ſhort though ſome of her Pieces may perhaps be loſt, and others in hands that have not produc'd them; yet none that upon good grounds could be known to be hers, are left out; for many of the leſs conſiderable ones were publiſh'd in the other; but thoſe, or others that ſhall be judged ſo, may be excuſed by the politeneſs of the reſt which have more of her true ſpirit, and of her diligence. Some of them would be no diſgrace to the name of any Man that amongſt us is moſt eſteemed for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in this kind, and there are none that may not paſs with favour, when it is remembred that they fell haſtily from the pen but of a Woman. We might well have call'd her the Engliſh <hi>Sappho,</hi> ſhe of all the female Poets of former Ages, being for her Verſes and her
<pb facs="tcp:96989:7"/>
Vertues both, the moſt highly to be valued; but ſhe has call'd her ſelf <hi>ORINDA,</hi> a name that deſerves to be added to the number of the Muſes, and to live with honour as long as they. Were our language as generally known to the world as the Greek and Latine were anciently, or as the French is now, her Verſes could not be confin'd within the narrow limits of our Iſlands, but would ſpread themſelves as far as the Continent has Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, or as the Seas have any ſhore. And for her Vertues, they as much ſurpaſs'd thoſe of <hi>Sappho</hi> as the Theological do the Moral, (wherein yet <hi>Orinda</hi> was not her inferiour) or as the fading immortality of an earthly Lawrel, which the juſtice of men cannot deny to her excellent Poetry, is tranſcended by that incorruptible and eternal Crown of Glory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Mercy of God hath undoubtedly rewarded her more eminent Piety. Her merit ſhould have had a Statue of Porphiry wrought by ſome great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, equal in skill to <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> that might have transferr'd to poſterity the laſting image of ſo rare a Perſon: but here is only a poor paper ſhadow of a Statue made after a Picture not very like her, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company that ſhe has drawn of her ſelf in theſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, and which repreſents the beauties of her mind with a far truer reſemblance, than that does the lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments of her Face. They had ſooner performed this Right to her memory, if that raging Peſtilence which, not long after her, ſwept away ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands here and in other places of this Kingdom, that devouring Fire, which ſince deſtroy'd this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City; and the harſh ſounds of War, which with the thunderings of Cannon, deafn'd all ears to the gentle and tender ſtrains of Friendſhip, had not made the Publication of them hitherto unſeaſonable. But they have out-liv'd all theſe diſmal things to ſee the bleſſing of Peace, a conjuncture more ſuitable to their Nature, all compos'd of kindneſs; ſo that I

                     <hi>Ovid</hi>'s concluſion of his <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis</hi> may with little alteration, more truth, and leſs vanity than by him to himſelf, be applyed to theſe once transformed, or rather deformed Poems, which, are here in ſome meaſure reſtor'd to their native Shape and Beauty, and therefore certainly cannot fail of a welcome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception now, ſince they wanted it not before, when they appeared in that ſtrange diſguiſe.</p>

                        <hi>A Sea-voyage from</hi> Tenby <hi>to</hi> Briſtol, <hi>begun</hi> Sept. 5. 1652. <hi>ſent from</hi> Briſtol <hi>to</hi> Lucaſia <hi>Sept.</hi> 8. 1652.</head>
                     <l>HOiſe up the Sail, cry'd they who underſtand</l>
                     <l>No word that carries kindneſs for the Land:</l>
                     <l>Such ſons of clamour, that I wonder not</l>
                     <l>They love the Sea, whom ſure ſome Storm begot.</l>
                     <l>Had he who doubted Motion theſe men ſeen,</l>
                     <l>Or heard their tongues, he had convinced been.</l>
                     <l>For had our Bark mov'd half as faſt as they,</l>
                     <l>We had not need caſt Anchor by the way.</l>
                     <l>One of the reſt pretending to more wit,</l>
                     <l>Some ſmall <hi>Italian</hi> ſpoke, but murther'd it;</l>

For I (thanks to <hi>Saburra</hi>'s Letters) knew</l>
                     <l>How to diſtinguiſh 'twixt the falſe and true.</l>
                     <l>But t' oppoſe theſe as mad a thing would be</l>
                     <l>As 'tis to contradict a Presbyt'ry.</l>
                     <l>'Tis <hi>Spaniſh</hi> though, (quoth I) e'en what you pleaſe<hi>:</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>For him that ſpoke it 'tmight be Bread and Cheeſe.</l>
                     <l>So ſoftly moves the Bark which none controuls,</l>
                     <l>As are the meetings of agreeing Souls:</l>
                     <l>And the Moon-beams did on the water play,</l>
                     <l>As if at Midnight 'twould create a Day.</l>
                     <l>The amorous Wave that ſhar'd in ſuch diſpence</l>
                     <l>Expreſt at once delight and reverence.</l>
                     <l>Such trepidation we in Lovers ſpye</l>
                     <l>Under th' oppreſſion of a Miſtreſs eye.</l>
                     <l>But then the Wind ſo high did riſe and roar,</l>
                     <l>Some vow'd they'd never truſt the traitor more.</l>
                     <l>Behold the fate that all our Glories ſweep,</l>
                     <l>Writ in the dangerous wonders of the Deep:</l>
                     <l>And yet behold Man's eaſie folly more,</l>
                     <l>How ſoon we curſe what erſt we did adore.</l>
                     <l>Sure he that firſt himſelf did thus convey,</l>
                     <l>Had ſome ſtrong paſſion that he would obey.</l>
                     <l>The Bark wrought hard, but found it was in vain</l>
                     <l>To make its party good againſt the Main,</l>
                     <l>Toſs'd and retreated, till at laſt we ſee</l>
                     <l>She muſt be faſt if ere ſhe ſhould be free.</l>
                     <l>We gravely Anchor caſt, and patiently</l>
                     <l>Lie priſoners to the weather's cruelty.</l>
                     <l>We had nor Wind nor Tyde, nor ought but Grief,</l>
                     <l>Till a kind Spring-tide was our firſt relief.</l>
                     <l>Then we float merrily, forgetting quite</l>
                     <l>The ſad confinement of the ſtormy night.</l>
                     <l>E're we had loſt theſe thoughts, we ran aground,</l>
                     <l>And then how vain to be ſecure we found.</l>
                     <l>Now they were all ſurpriz'd. Well, if we muſt,</l>
                     <l>Yet none ſhall ſay that duſt is gone to duſt.</l>
                     <l>But we are off now, and the civil Tide</l>
                     <l>Aſſiſted us the Tempeſts to out-ride.</l>

                     <l>A growing Navy, or a floating Wood.</l>
                     <l>But I have done at laſt, and do confeſs</l>

                     <l>The greateſt Actions paſs without a noiſe,</l>
                     <l>And Tumults but prophane diviner Joys.</l>

                     <l>The greateſt Emperours are ſerv'd by Mutes.</l>
                     <l>And as in ancient time the Deities</l>
                     <l>To their own Prieſts reveal'd no Myſteries</l>
                     <l>Until they were from all the World retir'd,</l>
                     <l>And in ſome Cave made fit to be inſpir'd.</l>
                     <l>So when <hi>Roſania</hi> (who hath them out-vied,</l>
                     <l>And with more Juſtice might be Deified;</l>
                     <l>Who if ſhe had their Rites and Altars, we</l>
                     <l>Should hardly think it were Idolatry)</l>
                     <l>Had found a breaſt that did deſerve to be</l>
                     <l>Receptacle of her Divinity;</l>
                     <l>It was not fit the gazing World ſhould know</l>
                     <l>When ſhe convey'd her ſelf to him, or how.</l>
                     <l>An Eagle ſafely may behold the Sun,</l>
                     <l>When weak Eyes are with too much Light undone.</l>
                     <l>Now as in Oracles were underſtood,</l>
                     <l>Not the Prieſt's only, but the common good:</l>

So her great Soul would not imparted be,</l>
                     <l>But in deſign of general Charity.</l>
                     <l>She now is more diffuſive than before,</l>
                     <l>And what men then admir'd, they now adore.</l>
                     <l>For this Exchange makes not her Power leſs,</l>
                     <l>But only fitter for the World's Addreſs.</l>
                     <l>May then that Mind (which if we will admit</l>
                     <l>The Univerſe one Soul, muſt ſure be it)</l>

                     <l>That ſure the world had full Eternity.</l>
                     <l>For though it ſelf to Time and Fate ſubmit,</l>
                     <l>He's above both who made and governs it;</l>
                     <l>And to each Creature hath ſuch Portion lent,</l>
                     <l>As Love and Wiſdom ſees convenient.</l>
                     <l>For he's no Tyrant, nor delights to grieve</l>
                     <l>The Beings which from him alone can live.</l>
                     <l>He's moſt concern'd, and hath the greateſt ſhare</l>
                     <l>In man, and therefore takes the greateſt care</l>
                     <l>To make him happy, who alone can be</l>
                     <l>So by Submiſſion and Conformity.</l>
                     <l>For why ſhould Changes here below ſurprize,</l>
                     <l>When the whole World its revolution tries?</l>
                     <l>Where were our Springs, our Harveſts pleaſant uſe,</l>
                     <l>Unleſs Viciſſitude did them produce?</l>
                     <l>Nay, what can be ſo weariſome a pain</l>
                     <l>As when no Alterations entertain?</l>
                     <l>To loſe, to ſuffer, to be ſick and die,</l>
                     <l>Arreſt us by the ſame Neceſſity.</l>
                     <l>Nor could they trouble us, but that our mind</l>
                     <l>Hath its own glory unto droſs confin'd.</l>
                     <l>For outward things remove not from their place,</l>
                     <l>Till our Souls run to beg their mean embrace;</l>
                     <l>Then doting on the choice make it our own,</l>
                     <l>By placing Trifles in th' Opinion's Throne.</l>
                     <l>So when they are divorc'd by ſome new croſs,</l>
                     <l>Our Souls ſeem widow'd by the fatal loſs:</l>
                     <l>But could we keep our Grandeur and our ſtate,</l>
                     <l>Nothing below would ſeem unfortunate;</l>
                     <l>But Grace and Reaſon, which beſt ſuccours bring,</l>
                     <l>Would with advantage manage every thing;</l>
                     <l>And by right Judgment would prevent our moan</l>
                     <l>For loſing that which never was our own.</l>
                     <l>For right Opinion's like a Marble grott,</l>
                     <l>In Summer cool, and in the Winter hot;</l>
                     <l>A Principle which in each Fortune lives,</l>
                     <l>Beſtowing Catholick Preſervatives.</l>

'Tis this reſolves, there are no loſſes where</l>
                     <l>Vertue and Reaſon are continued there.</l>
                     <l>The meaneſt Soul might ſuch a Fortune ſhare,</l>
                     <l>But no mean Soul could ſo that Fortune bear.</l>
                     <l>Thus I compoſe my thoughts grown inſolent,</l>
                     <l>As th' <hi>Iriſh</hi> Harper doth his Inſtrument;</l>

                           <l>Which to it, is, by its own danger preſt?</l>
                           <l>And when the Care we take to right the dead</l>

                           <l>Which does the Beauty of his actions hide.</l>
                           <l>Love is concern'd in't too, and he does fight</l>

                           <l>Judge of their height; <hi>Valerius</hi> then I met,</l>
                           <l>And could ev'n him behold without regret:</l>

                           <l>My Soul thoſe fatal Objects did reject,</l>
